Go to xe.com
Scroll to the middle of the page and find "XE Live Exchange Rates"
Create a page in vue.js that shows the rates table

Expected main functionality:
* Retrieving rates from the API
* Showing rows and columns of currency rates

Nice to haves:
* Displaying flags
* Inverse
* Add currency
* Rate timestamp

Ignore:
* Region dropdown
* Bell and newsletter icons
* Remove currency
* Refresh countdown

Note:
* Functionality is more important than look and feel. If you have limited time, prioritize functionality.
* Completing the Expected is more important than working on the Nice to have items.
* It is expected that the code is well-factored and clean.
